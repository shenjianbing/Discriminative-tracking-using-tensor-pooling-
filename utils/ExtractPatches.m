function patches = ExtractPatches( img, params )
%==========================================================================
% Divide gray level images into patches
% Input arguments
%   img.........h x w x n gray level images
%   params......an option structure whose fields are as follows:
%       patch_sz: a 1-by-2 integer vector that indicates the size of blocks. 
%               If block_sz is a scalar, size of all dimensions will be the
%               same. (required)
%       overlap_sz: a 1-by-2 integer vector that indicates the size of
%               overlaps. If overlap_sz is a scalar, overlap size of all
%               dimensions will be the same.(required)
%       decouple: a logical variable. If it is true, then each spatial
%               slice of blocks is vectorized.(default true)
% Output arguments:
% 	patches......the extracted patches.
